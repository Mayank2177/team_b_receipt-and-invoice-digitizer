# Receipt-and-Invoice-Digitizer

### Description:

**MyDigiBill** is an automated receipt and invoice digitization system that inputs images/document through multiple formats (jpg, png, pdf), preprocesses them for optimal quality, and uses OCR technology (Tesseract) to extract text. An NLP-based extraction + regex engine then intelligently identifies and structures key fields like vendor details, line items, amounts, dates, and taxes into a standardized database format. The system validates extracted data against business rules, stores it in a searchable database with original image references, and provides API integration with popular accounting/ERP systems along with a user-friendly dashboard for review, search, analytics, and export capabilities—ultimately eliminating manual data entry, reducing errors, and enabling real-time financial insights.
